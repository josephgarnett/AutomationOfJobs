		There are three main factors that affect the probability of whether a job can be automated:
		• Social Intelligence - Human emotion is difficult for machines to understand & even harder for a machine to respond to in the appropriate manor
		• Creativity - Coming up with ideas or artifacts that are novel & valuable.
			The difficulty here for machines is that creativity is an arcane concept for humans & therefore that makes it hard to encode into machines
		• Perception & Manipulation - Humans very adept at identifying & handling objects in any environment.  
		For machines to be able to do tasks involving perception and manipulation the work environment has to be designed to accommodate.
			These 3 factors form the basis for the probability of automation score given below
